=============

Name
----
aurpublish - PKGBUILD management framework for the Arch User Repository


Synopsis
--------
'aurpublish' [options] PACKAGE

'aurpublish' log [<options>] PACKAGE

'aurpublish' setup


Description
-----------
Aurpublish is an utility which helps maintainers of aur packages to submit updates.


How it works
------------
Commit PKGBUILDs in named subdirectories.
Export them to the AUR with the aurpublish command, using the subtree push 
stratagem. This preserves an independent history for third-party hosting, 
pull requests... ;)

Commands
--------

*setup*::
        Initialize a new repository with git hooks.

*log* <PACKAGE>::
        View the git log of a package subtree.

Options
-------

*-p* <PACKAGE>::
        Instead of publishing, pull changes from the AUR.
        Can import packages into a new subtree.

*-s*, *--speedup* <PACKAGE>::
        Speedup future publishing by recording the subtree history during 
        a push. This creates a merge commit and a second copy of all 
        commits in the subtree. For more details, see the "--rejoin" 
        option in git subtree.

*-h*, *--help*::
        Prints a usage page.

Hooks
-----

*pre-commit*::
        Warn about whitespace errors, fail if checksums don't match, and 
        auto-generate .SRCINFO for all changed PKGBUILDs.

*prepare-commit-msg*::
        Prefill the commit message with a list of added/updated/deleted 
        packages + versions (if any).

Examples
--------

aurpublish setup::
        Initialize a new repository with git hooks. Refer to Hooks section
        for more info.

aurpublish -p ansible-core-git::
        Clone existing package from aur and add its url as a git subtree to 
        the currently existing git repository.

aurpublish ansible-core-git::
        Push an existing subtree to AUR.

aurpublish log::
        View the git log of a package subtree.
